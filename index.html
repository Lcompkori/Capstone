      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a hairdresser by trade. After working behind the chair for 5 years, I apprenticed in Manhattan, New York for 6 years.</p> 
      <p>Now, I'm in my home-state of Pennsylvania. It feels good to be working behind the chair again, and growing my clientele. If you want beautiful hair, I'm your girl! </p>

          <p>Udemy has been one of my best friends. At first, I took some courses for data analytics and learned skills such as SQL and Tabelau. Learning about data, lead to a desire of learning more about coding and web development. I now have experience using HTML and CSS, and frameworks, such as Bootstrap. My favorite thing I've learned so far is the hands-on experience using Flexbox and Grid layouts.</p>
